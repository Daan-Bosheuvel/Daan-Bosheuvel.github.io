Did you know that octopuses have three hearts? Two hearts pump blood to the gills, where it gets oxygen. One heart pumps the oxygenated blood to the rest of the body. This unique circulatory system helps them survive in their underwater environment, where oxygen levels can vary.

Their blood is blue due to a copper-rich protein called hemocyanin, which is more efficient than hemoglobin in low-oxygen environments. Octopuses are known for their problem-solving skills and have been observed using tools. They can also regenerate lost arms, which can grow back over time.

Next time you think of octopuses, remember just how extraordinary they are!
